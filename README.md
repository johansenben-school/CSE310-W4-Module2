# Overview

C++ Chess game using the sdl2 library; 
This was my first time using c++ in a few years and I haddn't used sdl2 before and i couldn't get cmake to work before now; this project reminded me of some of the problems with c++ and why I stopped using it, but cmake at least got rid of most of the compiling problems
